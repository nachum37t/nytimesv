# `gcpvault` Examples

We've provided basic examples of applications capable of running on Google App Engine Standard or Flexible environments, Serverless platform or even Kubernetes.

To run any examples locally, users must have the Vault CLI tool installed.

See [Vault's documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install/index.html) for installation instructions.
